# ROS Driver for TI's mmWave Radars

[![Build Test](https://github.com/ethz-asl/ti_mmwave_rospkg/actions/workflows/build_test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ethz-asl/ti_mmwave_rospkg/actions/workflows/build_test.yml)

This package provides a ROS package for TI's mmWave radars.

It is forked from Leo Zhang's [work](https://github.com/radar-lab/ti_mmwave_rospkg), which itself is based on TI's [ROS driver](https://dev.ti.com/tirex/explore/node?node=AJVkbvjyhr4p7F6L5Elt4w__VLyFKFf__LATEST). This fork aims to update and simplify the code and make it more accessible for robotic applications with short to medium-range sensing requirements. We believe that this small form-factor antenna on package (AOP) chip design features some unique capabilities thanks to its little weight and low power consumption.

## Devices and Software

The package has been tested with the following setups:

* Devices
  * AWR 1843AOP evaluation module
  * AWR & IWR 6843AOP evaluation module
* Software (Ubuntu / ROS)
  * 18.04 / Melodic
  * 20.04 / Noetic
* SDK version: 3.5

The devices typically come with the out-of-box demo preinstalled, so most likely, you don't need to flash the evaluation module. If your sensors don't match with the SDK version (3.5), consider re-flashing them according to [this](https://dev.ti.com/tirex/explore/content/mmwave_industrial_toolbox_4_10_0/labs/Robotics/ros_driver/docs/TI_mmWave_ROS_Driver_Users_Guide.html#how-do-i-re-flash-the-ti-mmwave-evm-with-out-of-box-demo-) guide.

## Getting Started

![radar_rig](auxiliary/radar_rig_small.jpg "Radar rig")

Preliminary steps:

1. Connect the micro-USB (the one closer to the antenna) of the AOP sensor to the host machine running ROS.
2. Enable the `command` and `data` ports on Linux:
  
  ```shell
  sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB0
  sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB1
  ```
  
3. Test your sensor with the [Demo Visualizer](https://dev.ti.com/gallery/view/mmwave/mmWave_Demo_Visualizer/ver/3.5.0/) to check the connectivity and basic functionality. You can also create your own configuration file for your use-case (fps, range, velocity, etc.) with the visualizer.

Clone, build and launch:

4. Clone this repo and ROS serial onto your `<workspace dir>/src`:

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/ethz-asl/ti_mmwave_rospkg.git
  git clone https://github.com/wjwwood/serial.git
  ```
  
5. Go back to `<workspace dir>`, then build and source:

  ```shell
  catkin build
  source devel/setup.bash
  ```

6. Fire up the launch file:

  ```shell
  roslaunch ti_mmwave_rospkg ti_radar.launch
  ```

  Note: If you set `visualize` to `True`, then rviz should start and you should see something like the following:

  ![rviz](auxiliary/rviz_pointCloud.jpg "Rviz")
  
7. ROS topics can be accessed as follows:
  ```shell
  rostopic list
  rostopic echo /zero/ti_mmwave/radar_scan_pcl
  ```
8. ROS parameters can be accessed as follows:
  ```shell
  rosparam list
  rosparam get /ti_mmwave/max_doppler_vel
  ```
  
## Message format

The `radar_scan_pcl` is a customized point cloud topic, consisting of:

* location (x, y, z) in [m]
* radial range in [m]
* radial velocity in [m/s]
* intensity in [dB]
* noise [dB] // todo: add to driver

## Troubleshooting

1. Insufficient rights on ports:

  ```
  mmWaveCommSrv: Failed to open User serial port with error: IO Exception (13): Permission denied
  mmWaveCommSrv: Waiting 20 seconds before trying again...
  ```

  This happens when the serial port is called without superuser permission. Do the following steps:

  ```
  sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0
  sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM1
  ```

2. Sensor hiccup

  ```
  mmWaveQuickConfig: Command failed (mmWave sensor did not respond with 'Done')
  mmWaveQuickConfig: Response: 'sensorStop
  '?`????`????`???~' is not recognized as a CLI command
  mmwDemo:/>'
  ```

  When this happens, re-run the command you send to the sensor. If it continues, shut down and restart the sensor.

## Multiple devices support (todo: update this!)

Preparation:

* If you use multiple sensors, enable the additional ports, e.g. `/dev/ttyUSB2` and `/dev/ttyUSB3`, etc. accordingly.
* A better way to deal with multiple sensors is setting up your own udev-rule. Something along the following lines:
  * Gather the required information:
    * for idVendor:idProduct: `lsusb` => 10c4:ea70
    * for serial: `udevadm info -a /dev/ttyUSB0 | grep serial` => 00DEEBD8
    * for DEVPATH: `udevadm info /dev/ttyUSB0` => /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb1/1-6/1-6:1.0/ttyUSB0/tty/ttyUSB0
  * Then, go to `/etc/udev/rules.d` and create the udev-rule: `sudo gedit 99-usb-serial.rules` with the data from above:

    ```shell
    SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="10c4", ATTRS{idProduct}=="ea70", ATTRS{serial}=="00DEEDA3", DEVPATH=="/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb1/1-*/1-*:1.0/ttyUSB*/tty/ttyUSB*" SYMLINK+="ttyUSB.6843cli"
    SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="10c4", ATTRS{idProduct}=="ea70", ATTRS{serial}=="00DEEDA3", DEVPATH=="/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb1/1-*/1-*:1.1/ttyUSB*/tty/ttyUSB*" SYMLINK+="ttyUSB.6843data"

    SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="10c4", ATTRS{idProduct}=="ea70", ATTRS{serial}=="00DEEBD8", DEVPATH=="/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb1/1-*/1-*:1.0/ttyUSB*/tty/ttyUSB*" SYMLINK+="ttyUSB.1843cli"
    SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="10c4", ATTRS{idProduct}=="ea70", ATTRS{serial}=="00DEEBD8", DEVPATH=="/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb1/1-*/1-*:1.1/ttyUSB*/tty/ttyUSB*" SYMLINK+="ttyUSB.1843data"
    ```

Old:

1. Connect two devices and try `ll /dev/serial/by-id` or `ls /dev`. In this case, `/dev/ttyACM0` to `/dev/ttyACM3` should shown.
2. To avoid serial port conflict, you need to launch devices separately. So for the first device (it will open rviz):

  ```
  roslaunch ti_mmwave_rospkg multi_1642_0.launch 
  ```

3. Change radars' location in first three arguments `<node pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" name="radar_baselink_0" args="0 -1 0 0 0 0 ti_mmwave_pcl ti_mmwave_0 100"/>` (stands for x,y,z for positions) in launch file `multi_1642_1.launch`. And launch second device:

  ```
  roslaunch ti_mmwave_rospkg multi_1642_1.launch 
  ```

Note: As serial connection and the original code, you need to launch devices separately using different launch files.

## Camera overlay support (working with USB camera or CV camera) (todo: update this!)

1. Download and build USB camera repo [here](https://github.com/radar-lab/usb_webcam`). And set parameters of camera in `<usb_webcam dir>/launch/usb_webcam.launch`.
2. To test the device image working, try:

  ```
  roslaunch usb_webcam usb_webcam.launch
  rosrun rqt_image_view rqt_image_view  
  ```

3. Make sure you have done [ROS camera calibration](http://wiki.ros.org/camera_calibration) and create a `*.yaml` configuration file accordingly.
4. Launch radar-camera system using:

  ```
  roslaunch ti_mmwave_rospkg camera_overlay.launch
  ```
